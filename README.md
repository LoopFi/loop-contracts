# Loop DeFi Smart Contract

**Loop** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed to optimize yield distribution among participants through innovative lending, borrowing, and staking mechanisms.

## Overview

The platform's core concept revolves around leveraging ETH-based yields, utilizing receipt tokens, and staking mechanisms to align incentives between various actors:

- **Lenders:** Receive `lpETH` tokens in exchange for ETH deposits, which can be further staked to earn passive yield in ETH.
- **Borrowers (Loopers):** Can borrow ETH against yielding LRT derivatives to engage in carry trades and optimize returns on ETH-based yields.
- **dLP Lockers:** Lock the governance token `LOOP` into a Dynamic Liquidity Position (`dLP`) to earn protocol revenue.
- **Interest Rebates:** Loopers can offset borrow costs by locking 5% of their Total Looped Position Size in the `dLP`, effectively receiving rebates on interest paid.

## Core Smart Contracts

### 1. CDPVault

The `CDPVault` contract manages the core logic of the borrowing and lending functionalities. It allows users to deposit collateral, borrow against it, and handle repayments.

**Public Interface:**
- `deposit(address to, uint256 amount)`: Deposits collateral tokens into the vault.
- `withdraw(address to, uint256 amount)`: Withdraws collateral from the vault.
- `borrow(address borrower, address position, uint256 amount)`: Borrows ETH against collateral.
- `repay(address borrower, address position, uint256 amount)`: Repays borrowed ETH.

**Liquidity Management:**
The `CDPVault` utilizes `PoolV3` for liquidity management. The liquidity pool facilitates lending and borrowing activities, managing deposits, withdrawals, and interest accruals.

#### Interaction with PoolV3:
- **Borrowing:** The `CDPVault` borrows from `PoolV3` against the deposited collateral and the available liquidity.
- **Repayments:** Repayments to the vault are forwarded to `PoolV3`, updating the total debt and interest accordingly.

### 2. PoolV3

`PoolV3` is a Gearbox protocol contract that provides a liquidity pool for the `CDPVault`. It handles the aggregation of funds, debt management, and distribution of interest among liquidity providers.

**Key Functions:**
- `deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)`: Allows underlying asset deposits into the pool.
- `withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)`: Withdraws the specified amount from the pool.
- `lendCreditAccount(uint256 borrowedAmount, address creditAccount)`: Facilitates lending to credit accounts.
- `repayCreditAccount(uint256 repaidAmount, uint256 profit, uint256 loss)`: Handles repayments and adjusts the pool's state accordingly.

### 3. Treasury

The `Treasury` contract manages protocol revenues, distributing fees generated by the `CDPVault` and `PoolV3` among stakeholders, including dLP lockers and ETH stakers.

### 4. StakingLPEth

The `StakingLPEth` contract allows `lpETH` holders to stake their tokens and earn passive yield in ETH.

### 5. FlashLender

The `FlashLender` contract enables leveraging positions and executing flash loans for rapid liquidity operations within the protocol.
